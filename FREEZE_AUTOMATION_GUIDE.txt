MEGA FREEZE AUTOMATION SCRIPT - COMPLETE GUIDE
===============================================

🎯 WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
- Automatically calls the freeze() function on your MEGA contract
- Uses 30 different wallet addresses in rotation
- Runs every 60 minutes exactly
- Starts only when YOU manually trigger it
- Runs continuously until stopped

🔧 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

1. CONFIGURE YOUR 30 WALLETS:
   Edit freeze-automation.js and replace the WALLETS array:
   
   WALLETS: [
       { address: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', privateKey: '0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890' },
       { address: '0x2345678901234567890123456789012345678901', privateKey: '0xbcdefg2345678901bcdefg2345678901bcdefg2345678901bcdefg2345678901' },
       // ... add all 30 wallets
   ]

2. SET YOUR RPC ENDPOINT:
   Replace this line:
   RPC_URL: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY',
   
   With your actual Infura/Alchemy URL:
   RPC_URL: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-actual-key-here',

3. UPLOAD TO YOUR SERVER:
   scp freeze-automation.js root@80.78.30.115:/var/www/mega-ui/
   scp FREEZE_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.txt root@80.78.30.115:/var/www/mega-ui/

🚀 HOW TO RUN:

STEP 1: SSH into your server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/njal.la-key root@80.78.30.115
cd /var/www/mega-ui

STEP 2: Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install ethers@5.7.2

STEP 3: Start the bot
pm2 start freeze-automation.js --name mega-freeze-bot

STEP 4: Check it's running
pm2 status
pm2 logs mega-freeze-bot

You should see:
"⏳ Bot is ready and waiting for your manual trigger..."
"📝 To start automation: echo "START" > trigger-freeze.txt"

STEP 5: When you're ready to start the freeze automation
echo "START" > trigger-freeze.txt

🎯 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
- First freeze executes immediately using wallet #1
- Timer starts for exactly 60 minutes
- Next freeze uses wallet #2
- Continues every 60 minutes with wallets #3, #4, #5... #30
- After wallet #30, cycles back to wallet #1

📊 SAMPLE OUTPUT:
🎯 Manual trigger detected!
🚀 Starting freeze automation from manual trigger...
🎯 [2025-01-15T14:30:00.000Z] Executing freeze...
👤 Using wallet 1/30: 0x1234...
💰 Wallet balance: 0.15 ETH

📡 Transaction submitted: 0xabcd1234...
✅ Freeze executed successfully!
✅ Automation is now running every 60 minutes!
⏰ Next execution at: 2025-01-15T15:30:00.000Z

🛠️ USEFUL COMMANDS:

View logs:
pm2 logs mega-freeze-bot

Stop the bot:
pm2 stop mega-freeze-bot

Restart the bot:
pm2 restart mega-freeze-bot

Check PM2 status:
pm2 status

Restart timing (trigger again):
echo "START" > trigger-freeze.txt

Run without PM2 (for testing):
node freeze-automation.js

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. WALLET FUNDING: Make sure all 30 wallets have enough ETH for gas fees
   Recommended: 0.01 ETH per wallet minimum

2. TIMING: The 60-minute intervals start from when YOU trigger it
   If you trigger at 2:30 PM, next freeze is at 3:30 PM, then 4:30 PM, etc.

3. RESET: You can restart the timing by creating the trigger file again
   This will reset the cycle and start immediately

4. CONTRACT ADDRESS: The script automatically reads your current contract address
   from mega-ui/contracts/mega.ts - no manual updates needed

5. SAFETY: The script prevents multiple automations running at once

6. PERSISTENCE: Using PM2 means it survives server restarts

🔄 WALLET ROTATION CYCLE:
Hour 1: Wallet #1 calls freeze()
Hour 2: Wallet #2 calls freeze()
Hour 3: Wallet #3 calls freeze()
...
Hour 30: Wallet #30 calls freeze()
Hour 31: Wallet #1 calls freeze() (cycle repeats)

🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: "Could not find contract address"
Solution: Make sure mega-ui/contracts/mega.ts exists and has MEGA_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

Problem: "Please update CONFIG.RPC_URL"
Solution: Replace YOUR_INFURA_KEY with your actual RPC endpoint

Problem: Transaction fails
Solution: Check wallet has enough ETH, check network connection

Problem: Bot stops responding
Solution: pm2 restart mega-freeze-bot

Problem: Want to change timing
Solution: Stop bot, edit INTERVAL_MINUTES in script, restart

📝 QUICK START CHECKLIST:
□ Configure 30 wallets in WALLETS array
□ Set RPC_URL with your actual endpoint
□ Upload script to server
□ Start with: pm2 start freeze-automation.js --name mega-freeze-bot
□ Trigger with: echo "START" > trigger-freeze.txt
□ Monitor with: pm2 logs mega-freeze-bot
